# DevOps Learning Journey: Proxmox PVE and Infrastructure as Code

This repository documents my journey into the world of DevOps using Proxmox PVE and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. Here, I aim to share my learnings and create a resource for beginners to get started with Proxmox and IaC with minimal assistance.

## My DevOps Goals

I started this project with the goal of becoming a DevOps engineer. As a beginner, I found value in having clear, step-by-step instructions, and that's what I hope to provide here.

## Learning Through Documentation

This repository is divided into specific folders to guide you through different aspects of Proxmox PVE and IaC tools. Each folder contains detailed explanations, screenshots, and any scripts I've used in the process.

## Focus on the Learning Process

I've documented not only the final configurations but also the thought process behind them and the challenges I faced along the way. This will hopefully help you understand the "why" behind the "how" and troubleshoot any issues you might encounter.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This documentation will explore various IaC tools alongside Proxmox to automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration management. Here's a brief overview of the tools we'll cover:

- **Ansible**: A powerful automation tool that uses YAML playbooks to manage configurations across multiple systems.
- **Proxmox VE**: A virtualization platform that allows you to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) and containers.
- **Packer**: A tool for building identical machine images for different platforms.
- **Terraform**: An open-source IaC tool for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure.
- **Vagrant**: A tool for creating and managing lightweight, disposable virtual environments.
- **Containers**: Technologies like Docker and Podman that package software in a standardized unit for easy deployment and scaling.
